# PlenOctree Volume Rendering

---

This implementation is based on [PlenOctree](https://github.com/sxyu/volrend)

./volrend_headless ../data/lego/tree.npz -i ../data/lego/intrinsics.txt  $(ls -1v ../data/lego/pose/*) -o ../output_img

This is a real-time PlenOctree volume renderer written in C++ using OpenGL,
constituting part of the code release for:

The project has several repositories:

- NeRF-SH training and PlenOctree extraction <https://github.com/sxyu/plenoctree>
- PyTorch PlenOctree rendering CUDA extension <https://github.com/sxyu/svox>
- General NeRF visualization library <https://github.com/sxyu/nerfvis>

More will be released soon, we are taking a short break now.

## Building
Please install a recent version of CMake <https://cmake.org>

### Linux
```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j12
```

- If you do not have CUDA-capable GPU, pass `-DVOLREND_USE_CUDA=OFF` after `cmake ..` to use fragment shader backend, which is also used for the web demo.
  It is slower and does not support mesh-insertion and dependent features such as lumisphere probe.

The main real-time PlenOctree rendererer `volrend` and a headless version `volrend_headless` are built. The latter requires CUDA.
There is also an animation maker `volrend_anim`, which I used to make some of the video animations; don't worry about it unless interested.

You should be able to build the project as long as you have GLFW.
On Ubuntu, you will need X-server; you can try
`sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev libxi-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev`

### macOS
For macOS, we assume you have the homebrew package manager, and no CUDA-capable GPU.
```sh
brew install cmake
brew install glfw
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DVOLREND_USE_CUDA=OFF
export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib; export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="/usr/local/Cellar/glfw/3.3.4/include"; make -j8
```

### Windows 10
Install Visual Studio (I am using 2019 here). Then
```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -G"Visual Studio 16 2019"
cmake --build . --config Release
```
- If you do not have CUDA-capable GPU, pass `-DVOLREND_USE_CUDA=OFF` after `cmake ..` to use fragment shader backend, which is also used for the web demo.
  It is slower and does not support mesh-insertion and dependent features such as lumisphere probe.

The main real-time PlenOctree rendererer `volrend` and a headless version `volrend_headless` are built. The latter requires CUDA.
There is also an animation maker `volrend_anim`, which I used to make some of the video animations; don't worry about it unless interested.

### Dependencies
- C++17
- OpenGL
    - any dependencies of GLFW
- libpng-dev (only for writing image in headless mode and saving screenshot)

#### Optional
- CUDA Toolkit, I tried on both 11.0 and 10.2
    - Pass `-DVOLREND_USE_CUDA=OFF` to disable it.

## Run
```sh
./volrend <name>.npz
```
See `--help` for flags.

There is an ImGui window which exposes rendering options as well as interactive features mentioned in the paper + video.
For the mesh insertion, only OBJ files optionally with vertex coloring are supported. Texturing mapping is not implemented right now.
Some example meshes are in `sample_obj`, and a program to generate SH meshes (just for fun) is in `sample_obj/sh/gen_sh.cpp`.
Please use meshlab to triangulate other mesh.

### Keyboard + Mouse Controls (Desktop GUI)
- Left mouse btn + drag: rotate about camera position
- Right mouse btn + drag: rotate about origin point (can be moved)
- Middle mouse btn + drag: pan camera
- Shift + Left mouse btn + drag: pan camera (alt)
- Shift + middle mouse btn + drag: pan camera AND move origin point simultaneously
- Scroll with wheel: move forward/back in z
- WASDQE: move; Shift + WASDQE to move faster
- 123456: preset `world_up` directions, sweep through these keys if scene is using different coordinate system.
- 0: reset the focal length to default, if you messed with it
- Z: cycle gizmo operations translate/rotate/scale (only visible if mesh is opened in Manipulate section)
- X: toggle gizmo space local/world (applies to mesh translation/rotation)

Lumisphere probe:
- IJKLUO: move the lumisphere probe; Hold shift to move faster


### Offscreen Rendering

The program `volrend_headless` allows you to perform offscreen rendering on a server.

Usage: `./volrend_headless tree.npz -i intrinsics.txt pose1 pose2... [-o out_dir]`

intrinsics.txt should be a 4x4 intrinsics matrix.
pose1, pose2 ... should contain 3x4 or 4x4 c2w pose matrices,
or multiple matrices in a 4Nx4 format.
Add `-r` to use OpenCV camera space instead of NeRF.

The following zip file contains intrinsics and pose files for each scene of NeRF-synthetic,
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mI4xl9FXQDm_0TidISkKCp9eyTz40stE/view?usp=sharing>

Example to render out images:
`./volrend_headless drums/tree.npz -i data/nerf_synthetic/drums/intrinsics.txt data/nerf_synthetic/drums/pose/* -o tree_rend/drums`

The PNG writing is a huge bottleneck. Example to compute the FPS:
`./volrend_headless drums/tree.npz -i data/nerf_synthetic/drums/intrinsics.txt data/nerf_synthetic/drums/pose/*`

See `./volrend_headless --help` for more options such as setting rendering options.

## Precomputed PlenOctree Files
The full resolution tree files for NeRF-synthetic reported in the paper may be found at:
<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DIYj-iu3TOHProJVHPIQTjHnmYf80_vC?usp=sharing>

The uncompressed NeRF-synthetic files used for the web demo are here:
<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vGXEjb3yhbClrZH1vLdl2iKtowfinWOg?usp=sharing>
The compression script used to turn this in to the web version is in `scripts/compress_octree.py`.

More to come soon.

## PyTorch Extension: svox

You can find a (mostly) compatible PlenOctree library called `svox`, which we use to build the tree;
`pip install svox`.

- Code: <https://github.com/sxyu/svox>
- Documentation: <https://svox.readthedocs.io>

More information to be added soon.

## Building the Web Demo

The backend of the web demo is built from the shader version of the C++ source using emscripten.
Install emscripten per instructions here:
https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html

Then use
```sh
mkdir embuild && cd embuild
emcmake cmake ..
make -j12
```

The full website should be written to `embuild/build`.
Some CMake scripts even write the html/css/js files.
To launch it locally for previewing, you can use the make target:
```sh
make serve
```
Which should launch a server at http://0.0.0.0:8000/.
NEW: You may load local files and OBJs by using `Load Local` in the navbar.
Open `Layers` in the top right and click the camera layer to show cameras.
